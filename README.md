# cachefinance
A custom function and trigger to supplement GOOGLEFINANCE so data is always available and unsupported stocks can get price/name/yield data.  As you can guess from the name, data is cached so when '#N/A' appears it does not mess up your asset history logging/graphing.


After adding the script, it will require new permissions.

You need to open the script inside the Google Script editor, go to the Run menu and choose 'CacheFinanceBoot' from the dropdown. This will prompt you to authorize the script again and the triggers will function again with the correct permissions.
